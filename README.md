A minimum crate for non-blocking, continuous use of an access token, by ensuring it is constantly rotated ahead-of-time via refresh token. When a refresh token needs to be rotated, it is rotated with username/password credentials.

There is full API support for **wasm** and **native**. Android and iOS are untested (Help needed).
